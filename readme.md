Trying to re-implement the paper *Deep reinforcement learning for page-wise recommendations*. 

Not completely finished yet.

Add an RNN model to extract sequential features better.

In this version

- Simulator does not specify user identity.

- Rnn just processes embedded item.

- Rnn will not be updated together with ddpg.
